Given an array A[ ] of positive integers of size N, where each value represents the number of chocolates 
in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are M students, the task is to 
distribute chocolate packets among M students such that :
1. Each student gets exactly one packet.
2. The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates
given to a student is minimum.
