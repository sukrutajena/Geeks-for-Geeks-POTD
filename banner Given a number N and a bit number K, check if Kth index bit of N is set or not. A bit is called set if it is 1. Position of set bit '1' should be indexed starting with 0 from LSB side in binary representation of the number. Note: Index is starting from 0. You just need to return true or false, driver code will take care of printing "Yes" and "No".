Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth index bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' 
should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
Note: Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false, driver code will take care of printing "Yes" and "No".

class CheckBit
{
    // Function to check if Kth bit is set or not.
    static boolean checkKthBit(int n, int k)
    {
        // Your code here
        int check=1<<k;
        return (n & check)!=0;
    }
    
}
